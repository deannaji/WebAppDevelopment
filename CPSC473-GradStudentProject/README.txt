Name: Dean Naji


Skimmed Hacker News:
-------------------
This project is about creating a website similar to "Hacker News", along with learning and 
using new technologies. User can create a new account, login, like posts, and submit new posts.
Beside the technologies mentioned below, I used some JQuery functionality for DOM manipulation 
along with AngularJS, Because I was interested in utilizing both JQuery and AngularJS, for even more 
powerful and diversed implementation for the chosen problem.


Technologies:
------------
Client-side: AngularJS, JQuery
Server-side: SailsJS
NoSQL Database: MongoDB  


Client files:
-------------
All client-side html, JS, and CSS files are in the Assets folder.


Testing Data:
-------------
The Data.json file contains the testing data, and it should be imported by MongoDB.


Installation:
------------
The whole folder should moved to the server, along with installing all the dependancies, which you can
find in the Package.json file.
